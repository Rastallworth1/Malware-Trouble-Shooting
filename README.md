<br />
Run a Windows Defender offline Scan in order to scan the system before the Operatining System or any executables start. This may allow your system to find Malware in your central systems, such as as drivers. (This may take a while):  <br/>

<br />
<br />
Go to your System Restore Point. ** DO NOT restore your device ** Malware creators are aware of restore points and can create Malware to affect System Restore Points. It is better to remove System Restore Points. Type "create a restore point" in the system menu and open it. Click on configure, disable system protection, and delete the restore point. Once the issue is resolved, create a new restore point.  <br/>
